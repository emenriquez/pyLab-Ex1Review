# Exam 1 Review Exercise Lab

Complete the functions in `functions.py`

All functions should `return` values and input values from function parameters. There is no console input for functions. Console output using `print()` is not graded.

Additionally, there is a demo script `demo.py` where you can import your functions and test out any code to develop your solutions.

## Testing
You can test your code results with the tests that will be applied by the grader. To do this, enter the following command **in the terminal**:

`pip install pytest`

After this installs, you can run the command `pytest` (or `pytest -v` for more info) in the terminal to test your functions and see if the results are correct.
