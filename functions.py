# Lists
# Write a function "listMult()" to iterate through a list and multiply the list values by some factor
# input: list of numbers, multiplication factor
# Ex: theList = [5, 2, 4], factor=3, return: [15, 6, 12]



# String Operations
# Write a function "vowelComp()" that will take in two strings, and will return the string that has more vowels
#   if vowels are equal, print a message indicating they are equal and return the first string
# vowels here will count as (a, e, i, o, u, y)
# input: string1, string2
# Ex: string1 = "hello", string2 = "output", return: "output"



# Expressions and branches
# Write a function "richCalc()" that will determine if you make a lot of money
# input: salary
# return: "super rich" if salary is above 100
#           "rich" if salary is above 10
#           "kind of rich" if salary is above 1
#           "rich in spirit" otherwise


# Imports
# There are two functions written in "auxFunc.py"
#   First, import these functions into this file (do not copy them over)
#   Next, write a function "funcSub()" that will return the result of  ( func1(x) - func2(x) ) * func3(x)
#       where x is an input parameter for funcSub()
#       Example: x = 7, funcSub(7) result is ( func1(7) - func2(7) ) * func3(7)
